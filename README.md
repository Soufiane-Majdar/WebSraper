Web scraping is the process of extracting data from a website by parsing the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript of the website's pages. There are many tools and libraries available for web scraping, but it is also possible to do web scraping using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

It is important to note that web scraping can sometimes be against the terms of service of a website and may be considered illegal in some cases. It is important to respect the website's terms of service and any relevant laws when performing web scraping.
